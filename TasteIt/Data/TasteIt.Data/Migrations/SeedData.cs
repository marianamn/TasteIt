                Content = "Some say that a vacation isn't complete without trying the local foods, and with culinary tourism stronger than ever, people are even more adventurous about braving unfamiliar dishes. But as much as you may love to try new delicacies, there are plenty of exotic specialties you may think twice about seeing on your plate. Work up an appetite (or not) - these scary foods are notorious for stinking, looking weird and even causing death! Barbecued Bat (Indonesia) - Indonesia has some interesting dishes; the award for “most unusual” goes to the barbecued bat, served at local restaurants and street carts. Batman would be appalled, yet others find the dish quite delish. Cooks normally singe off the fur, then remove the wings and head. Depending on the size of the bat, the body is chopped up for stew or stir-fry (bones and all). Can't take the gamey smell (or taste) of the cave-dwelling mammal? Ask for extra garlic, pepper and chili. Try it at: Many street carts in Jakarta wheel up a good bat, but if you want a truly unforgettable experience, head to Tomohon Market in North Sulawesi, an otherwise macabre market that’s home to the motherload of bats (as well as pigs, monkeys, pythons and other animals). Another  one is Puffer Fish (Japan) - Japan may be known for preparing the world's best sushi, but here's one fish they might want to leave in the ocean. The puffer fish (or \"fugu\") is so poisonous (100 times more potent than cyanide!) it can kill someone -- literally -- as the diner who gets a lethal dose of the toxins can quickly submit to asphyxiation. Toxins must be removed so carefully that chefs need to be specially trained, licensed and certified by the government. The transparent fish tastes mild and clean but considering it's one of the most dangerous foods in the world, we say stick with tuna. Try it at: Although puffer fish is found throughout Japan, the restaurant chain Zuboraya (in Osaka) is recognized that serves it best.",

                Content = "Americans have all sort of rules and laws they follow, such as rules involving queuing (an art technique perfected in Singapore where the queue is king). By contrast, Italians have very few rules and most of those can be broken. For example, in Italy, there is a minimum drinking age but it's not really respected. Situation changes entirely when it comes to food. Yes. Italians do have eating rules! For example, my friend George from New York City once wanted to order a cafe latte with his Mexican meal - right in front of me!!! It took me a while to dissuade him... I hope no restaurant in Italy would ever allow its customers to have cappuccino together with pasta!  I have never been brave enough to order pasta 'alle vongole' and cappuccino together to test this rule: if you have more courage than I do, try that combination and see what happens.  I just realized that Italy, the place where there are almost no rules (for example on the road where the only rule is you don't stay in the left lane on an autostrada except to pass), has in fact very strict eating rules. The following rules are aimed to correct common American (unacceptable!) mistakes... Even McDonald's in Italy serves cappuccino for breakfast. In Italy, forget eggs and bacon or sausages for breakfast except possibly in a hotel that caters to American or English tastes. Cappuccino and brioche are one of the few 'legal' options. Maybe a yogurt. Probably having tea is already pushing it too far... Coffee may be drunk with fruit or desert but never with the main meal. In addition, traditionally coffees with milk (cappuccinos and lattes) are for breakfast. Lunch and dinner are followed by espressos, or, at most an espresso macchiato (this is a rule that my wife likes to break, but she likes to live dangerously and can talk back in Italian if someone challenges her). The Italian main meal is traditionally multi-course: restaurants like to serve you first and second plates and do not appreciate it when Americans insist on having one thing (although they have been getting more used to it in recent times). But keep in mind that Italian portion sizes are smaller than American's, and the mixture they serve (pasta/rice first, followed by meat/fish/vegetables, followed by fruit) is a relatively healthy balance. You may get fewer calories and a healthier, more balanced meal by eating three courses in Italy, rather than one, giant entrée covered with cheese in the United States. ",

For a soft-boiled egg, lower the egg into gently boiling water with a slotted spoon. Allow three and a half minutes for a medium-sized egg and four minutes for a large egg. The yolk will be runny and the white just set. Cook for a further minute if you like your soft boiled eggs a little firmer.For a hard-boiled egg, start the egg in cold water and bring up to the boil. Once the water is gently boiling, set the timer for between 7-10 minutes depending on how well cooked you like your eggs. The longer you boil the egg, the firmer it will be. Once cooked, plunge the hard-boiled egg into plenty of cold water for one minute. Drain and cover with more cold water. This will prevent the egg from over-cooking in its residual heat. Cracking the shell with the back of a spoon during cooling will also make the egg easier to peel.",

Place a griddle pan or heavy based frying pan over a high heat for at least five minutes. Hold the steak on the hot pan, standing it up on the fatty edge. Hold it there for 10-20 seconds until the fat begins to run onto the pan. Lay the steak on its side. Turn down the heat if your steak is very thick. On average, cook for two minutes on each side for a rare steak, three minutes for medium, and four minutes for well-done. However, the thickness of the steak will alter the cooking time. Pressing the steak down with a spatula will give a good brown crust. Once cooked to your liking, leave the steak to rest on a warm plate for five minutes, so the juices will settle evenly within the meat, while also allowing the meat to relax and become more tender.",

Adrenal fatigue may occur when we are chronically exposed to stress. Next to checking the symptoms, it is possible to have a cortisol profile determined by a physician, using saliva tests. Make sure the physician concerned knows what adrenal fatigue is. Regular medical protocols only involve cortisol values for Addison's disease and Cushing's syndrome.It is very important, after reading the symptoms and if you suspect adrenal fatigue, to tackle the causes. Try to find out which stress sources have the most impact on you. Focus on these sources and determine, if necessary by consulting a coach, how this stress may be reduced in order to allow your adrenal glands to be restored. Be aware of the fact that, if adrenal fatigue is actually the case, it will not suffice to go on a week's holiday.Food: Too much sugar, chemical E numbers, pesticides, and food for which you may be intolerant or allergic may be stress sources that can be avoided. The Hormone Balance Diet is hypoallergenic, and chemical E numbers and pesticides are avoided. Still, you may have a rare intolerance or allergy that is not included in this programme. Therefore, it is wise to keep a diary to find out whether other allergens may play a part.",

                Content = "I used to be green with envy when my friends who were working full-time jobs bought organically grown healthy foods while I was in grad school and keeping expenses tight. With many people struggling to pay the bills, organic foods produced without chemicals or additives seem like an unattainable luxury only a few can actually afford. While it wasn’t easy in grad school to budget for foods that kept me feeling healthy, happy, and strong, with a little research, I found that there are ways to keep your diet green and your pockets green too! First: Eat with the seasons. I love eating seasonal produce. When I started to tailor my diet according to the seasons, I noticed how my body would change as well. Did you know that in the winter months the body actually calls for more food? Body fat is an evolutionary adaptation to insulate us from cold weather and even provides us with an emergency source of caloric energy. When you purchase food, you’re paying for packaging costs as well, which can add up. When purchasing in bulk, you not only get a little workout, but you aren’t paying for all of the packaging associated with single items. When I buy organics in bulk I buy nuts, grains, and dried fruit. This really does save you a lot and is good for the environment too. I know what you’re probably thinking… “Yeah right, I don’t have the time to grow anything to feed my family with! It’s busy enough to go to the market and shop for groceries.”  I am not saying that you need to start a greenhouse, but you may have fun and save money by growing some produce. I suggest planting basil or tomatoes to start with. If you don’t feel like starting from a seed, you could even buy an already fruitful plant and just maintain it. ",
